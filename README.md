# Demo Product Management
In this demo I separate code to be 2 sides. 
First it's web application driven by Angularjs2, Typescript and Bootstrap technologies.
Second it's web-api application driven by .net core technologies.

# How to start this Demo
1. Run web-api application with Visual studio 2015 update 4 or higher.
2. Install "npm install" by command line. The command line must go through web-app application folder path.
3. start by command line "npm start" to run the application.
