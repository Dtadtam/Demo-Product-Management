Angular Modules Concept

Bootstrap Array
- Every application must bootstrap at least one component, the root application component.

Declarations Array
- Every component, directive, and pipe we create must belong to one and only one Angular module.
- Only declare components, directives, and pipes.
- Never re-declare components, directives, or pipes that belong to another module.
- All declared components, directives, and pipes are private by default.
  They are only accessible to other components, directives, and pipes declared in the same module.
- The Angular module provides the template resolution environment for its component templates.

Exports Array
- Export any component, directive, or pipe if another component needs it.
- Re-export modules to re-export thier components, directives, and pipes.
- We can re-export something without importing it first.
- Never export a service.

Imports Array
- Importing a module makes available any exported components, directives, and pipes from that module.
- Only import what this module needs.
- Importing a module does NOT provide access to its imported modules.

Providers Array
- Any service provider added to the providers array is registered at the root of the application.
- Don't add service to the providers array of a shared module.
- Routing guards must be added to the providers array of an Angular module.
